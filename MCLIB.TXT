MSX-C Library Backward Compatible Library for SOLID C
By Tatsuhiko Syoji (Tatsu) 1999-2000

[About this Library]
This library is a port of a portion of the MSX-C Library to SOLID C.
The source code is original and unrestricted, so it may be freely used and distributed.

[Library Development]
The author himself has not used the curses library, and it is not considered suitable for MSX, so there are no plans to port it.
Other functions with complex implementations, such as the numerical calculation library, have not been ported.
However, for game development, which is the primary purpose of this library, the functions provided in this library should be sufficient.

Other useful original functions have been integrated, such as CPU-related functions for the MSX Turbo R, which was released after the release of the MSX-C Library, functions for VDP commands, and a VRAM access function that allows all 17 bits to be set in the read/write address.

[Required Environment]
SOLID C Operating Environment

[Configuration Files]
GLIB.H: Graphics library header file.
MSXBIOS.H: BIOS library header file.
MLIB.IRL: Assembled object file for this library.

BIOSSRC.LZH: BIOS library source file.
GRPSRC.LZH: Graphics library source file.

BIOS.TXT: BIOS library manual.
GLIB.TXT: Graphics library manual.
MCLIB.TXT: This text.
LICENCE.TXT: License document.
HISTORY.TXT: Revision history of this package.

[Installation Instructions]
Copy GLIB.H and MSXBIOS.H to the header file location in your SOLID C setup environment, and MLIB.IRL to the library file location.
In your program, include the header file containing the functions used in the source file, and link MLIB.IRL with the linker.
Note that to ensure source file compatibility with the MSX-C Library, including glib.h will also include msxbios.h.
